# Bioinformatics_python_Scripts
Python scripts to solve Bioinformatics/Computational Biology tasks

# 1-CountingDNANucleotide.py 
    CountingDNANucleotide.py is for Counting DNA Nucleotides(A,C,G,T).
# 2-TranscribingDNAintoRNA.py
    TranscribingDNAintoRNA.py is for Transcribing DNA into RNA(In transcription from DNA into RNA,we do uracil in place of thymine)
# 3-ComplementingStrandofDNA.py
    ComplementingStrandofDNA.py is for Complementing a Strand of DNA(Reversing the DNA sequence and then taking the complement of each symbol i.esymbols 'A' and 'T' are complements of each other, as are 'C' and 'G'.
# 4-RabbitCount.py
    RabbitCount.py is used to calculate the total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs where k is the number of offspring
# 5-ComputingGCContent.py 
    ComputingGCContent.py is for computing the highest GC-content in  DNA strings in FASTA format.
# 6-CountingPointMutations.py
    CountingPointMutations.py is for Counting Point Mutations(base change in nucleotide) in DNA.(Hamming Distance)
# 7-DominantAllele.py
    DominantAllele.py is for computing an individual possessing a dominant allele.
